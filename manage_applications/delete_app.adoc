. Confirm the removal to delete the application.
. When the list of all applications is refreshed, the application is no longer included.

To use the Kubernetes CLI tool, complete the following steps:

. Replace `name` and `namespace` with the name of your application and your target namespace:

----
kubectl delete Application <name> -n <namespace>
