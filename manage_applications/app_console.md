# Applications console

The console includes an applications dashboard for managing the application lifecycle. You can use the console dashboard to create and manage applications, subscriptions, channels, and placement rules. You can also view the status of your applications and channels. The dashboard includes enhanced capabilities, which your developers and operations personnel can use to create, deploy, update, manage, visualize, and monitor applications across your clusters. 

See the following application console capabilities:

* Scan your deployment pipeline to view the deployed applications across your clusters, including any associated channels and subscriptions.
* View events in the context of an application, including deployments, updates, and monitoring data.
* Access a topology view that encompasses the new application resource definitions, including channels, subscriptions, and placement rules.
* View the log for a pod in an application.
* Add and edit channels, subscriptions, placement rules, and applications from different views and pages.
