# Applications console

The console includes an applications dashboard for managing the application lifecycle. You can use the console dashboard to create and manage application, subscriptions, channels, and placement rules. You can also use the console to view the status of your applications, channels, subscriptions, and related deployments.

The dashboard includes enhanced capabilities, which your developers and operations personnel can use to create, deploy, update, manage, visualize, and monitor applications across your clusters. With this application dashboard, you can complete the following tasks:

* View your deployment pipeline to view all deployed applications across your clusters, including any associated channels and subscriptions.
* View events in the context of an application, including deployments, updates, and monitoring data.
* Access an improved topology view that encompasses the new application resource definitions, including channels, subscriptions, and placement rules.
* View a the logs tab for applications to view logs for each application resource.
* When Grafana is installed, you can open the Grafana dashboard for your applications from the applications dashboard to monitor your applications.
* Add and edit channels, subscriptions, placement rules, and applications from different views and pages.

  **Note:** The application dashboard shows only the application resources that use the new custom resource definitions. Application resources that are based on the definitions that were used for previous versions of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes are not displayed. You can migrate your older style application resources to use the new definitions and have your resources display in the console.
