= View placement rule status

When a placement rule is created and in use, you can view the status details for the rule.
This status is appended to the YAML definition for a placement rule and indicates the target clusters where the rule is used for placing deployables.

To view the status fields for a placement rule, you can use the console, the Kubernetes command line interface (`kubectl`) tool, or REST API.

* To use the console,
 .. Open the console.
 .. Click the *Search* icon in the Header.
 .. Within the search box, filter by `kind:placementrule` to view all placement rules.
 .. Within the list of all placement rules, click the placement rule that you want review.
The YAML for that rule is displayed.
 .. Review the fields and values within the `status` section of the YAML content.
* To use the Kubernetes CLI tool, run the following command.
Replace `name` and `namespace` with the name of the placement rule and the target namespace:
 .. Run the following command
+
----
kubectl get PlacementRule <name> -n <namespace>
----

 .. Review the fields and values within the `status` section of the YAML content.
