# Networking configuration

Configure your network settings to allow the following connections:

Hub cluster:
- Outbound connectivity to cloud provider's API
- Outbound connectivity to the Kubernetes API server of the Hive provisioned `ManagedCluster` on port 443 (so Hive-driven `openshift-install` is successful)
- Outbound connectivity from the Hub to the channel source, including Github, Object Store, and Helm repository
- Outbound and inbound connectivity to the `WorkManager` service route on the ManagedCluster on port 443 (for gathering logs)
- Inbound connectivity to the hub cluster's kube API server from the `ManagedCluster` on port 6443 (for Klusterlet/KlusterletAddon)
- Inbound connectivity for post-commit hook from GitHub to the Hub
- Inbound connectivity from the Observatorium prometheus collector on the managed cluster to the Hub Thanos datastore


Managed cluster:
- Inbound connectivity to the Kubernetes API server from the hub cluster on port 6443 (Hive)
- Inbound connectivity to `WorkManager` service endpoint from the hub cluster on port 443 (for logging)
- Outbound connectivity to the hub cluster's Kubernetes API server on port 6443 (for Klusterlet/KlusterletAddon)
- Outbound connectivity from the Hub to channel source, including Github, Object Store, and Helm repository
- Outbound connectivity from the Observatorium prometheus collector on the managed cluster to the Hub Thanos datastore
