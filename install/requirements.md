# Networking configuration

Hub cluster:
- outbound connectivity to cloud provider's API, port 443 for Google Cloud Platfrom Amazon Web Service
- outbound connectivity to the Kubernetes API server of the Hive provisioned managed cluster (so Hive-driven `openshift-install` is successful)
- outbound connectivity to the `WorkManager` service endpoint on the managed cluster (for gathering logs)
- inbound connectivity to the hub cluster's Kubernetes API server from the managed cluster (for Klusterlet/KlusterletAddon)

Managed cluster:
- inbound connectivity to the Kubernetes API server from the hub cluster (Hive)
- inbound connectivity to `WorkManager` service endpoint from the hub cluster (for logging)
- outbound connectivity to the hub cluster's Kubernetes API server (for Klusterlet/KlusterletAddon)

Hive:
- outbound connectivity from Hub to the cloud provider's API
- inbound/outbound connectivity from Hub to the kube API server of the provisioned cluster

Klusterlet/KlusterletAddon
- inbound connectivity from ManagedCluster to Hub's kube API server

WorkManager log feature:
