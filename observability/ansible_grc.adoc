= Integrating governance with Ansible Tower

{product-title} governance can be integrated with Ansible Tower automation to create policy violation automations. You can configure the automation from the {product-title-short} console.

[#prerequisites-grc-ansible]
== Prerequisites

* {ocp} 4.5 or later

* You must have Ansible Tower version 3.7.3 or a later version installed. It is best practice to install the latest supported version of Ansible Tower. See [Red Hat AnsibleTower documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/) for more details.

* Install the Ansible Automation Platform Resource Operator on to your hub cluster to connect Ansible jobs to the governance framework. For best results when using the AnsibleJob to launch Ansible Tower jobs, the Ansible Tower job template should be idempotent when it is run.
