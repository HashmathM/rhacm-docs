# Creating a provider connection

A *provider connection* is required to create a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on a cloud service provider with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

The provider connection stores the access credentials and configuration information for a provider. Each provider account requires its own provider connection, as does each domain on a single provider. 

The following files detail the information that is required for creating a connection document for each supported provider:

- [Creating a provider connection for Google Cloud Platform](prov_conn_google.md)
