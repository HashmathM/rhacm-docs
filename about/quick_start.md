# Getting started 

## Introduction

Review the [Architecture](architecture.md) topic and the [Components](components.md) topics to learn more about what is installed with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

## Install

1. Before you install Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, review the required hardware and system configuration for each product at [Requirements and recommendations](install/requirements.md).

2. You want to ensure that you have a supported Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version so that you can set up your hub cluster. You also need to ensure that your hub cluster has the appropriate capacity. To prepare your hub cluster, see [Preparing your hub cluster for installation](install/prep.md).

With a supported version of OpenShift Container Platform installed on premise and a prepared target hub cluster, you can proceed with [Installing while connected online](install/install_connected.md).

After installation, review the [Web console](console/console_intro) guide to learn how to see your console and what features are available in the console.

## Manage clusters

You are ready to create and import clusters. 

1. See [Creating a cluster](managed_cluster/create.md) to learn about the types of clusters you can create. When you create a cluster, you import the cluster automatically.

2. If you have a cluster that you want to import, you can view [Importing a cluster](managed_cluster/import.md) to learn how to import.
